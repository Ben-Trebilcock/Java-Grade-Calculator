An assignment for my Java class. The requirements are as follows:

## Problem:

Given a student's numerical grade, output a corresponding letter grade based on a standard grading scale.
## Input:

Processing:

Use if-else statements to determine the letter grade based on the numerical grade.
For example:
If grade >= 94, letter grade = "A"
If grade >= 90, letter grade = "A-"
... (see syllabus for remaining categories)
## Output:

 Print the student's first name and last name, the letter grade, and the percent score formatted to 2 decimal points.
Example Run:

Hello, what is your first name? Michael
